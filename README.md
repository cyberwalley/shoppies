# The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs
After several monumental successes in the commerce space, Shopify has recently branched out into movie award shows. On their request, I have built an app to help manage the movie nominations for the maiden edition of the Shoppies :)

The goal of this project is do the following:

* Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
* Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
* View the list of films already nominated
* Remove a nominee from the nomination list


### Libraries
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* Google fonts

### API
* [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

### Help
* [How to use the app](https://shoppies-awards.netlify.app/help.html)
